# Mudskipper Autonomous Robot

This code implements an autonomous mudskipper robot using ESP32. The robot mimics the unique  
movement of a mudsskipper fish with the help of 4 servos, two servos for each fin.

To run the code, simply download it and open it in VS code, install PlatformIO extension
and let it take care of the libraries and stuff.

Build and upload to your board and marvel at the monstrosity that you have created.
