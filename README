This code implements an autonomous mudskipper robot using ESP32. The robot mimics the unique  
movement of a mudskipper fish with the help of 4 servos, two servos for each fin.

To run the code, simply download it and open it in VS code.  

Make sure that you have installed PlatformIO extension on your VS Code.

The circuit diagram for the project is in the circuit folder, use Fritzing to open the Mudskip.fzz file.
